# sparta-global-mini-portfolio
This project was built in html and css. The project was designed to be an introductory look at webpage design, spacing, and responsiveness (to different screen sizes.)

## i) Structure
The website is comprised of many container `<div>`s with content being held within these. These were used

## ii) Positioning and alignment
Alignment was achieved using
```css
html,body{
  text-align: center;
}
```
as well as
```css
.parent{
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column/row;
}
.child{
  flex: <ratio>;
}
```
The former was used to center generic objects, (which would be inherited by div to center align images and containers). Flex boxes were used to position containers and containers within containers; to equate containers in height, size containers proportionally (using `<ratio>`), and to direct the order of stacking (in rows or columns.)
